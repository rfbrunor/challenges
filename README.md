Download the complete project and unzip it into a folder

Ensure that the main.py and data files are at the same level, the data folder is necessary for it to work correctly

Download and install Python for Windows 64 bits version 3.12.0
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/

Install components below preferably in virtual env:
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install folium

Add the Details_Data.csv, Price_AV_Itapema-001.csv and VivaReal_Itapema.csv files to the "data" folder
Run the python main.py file (ensure your root directory is before the main.py file location

OBS: If the Price_AV_Itapema_filtered.csv file is in the "data" folder, it will be used instead of the Price_AV_Itapema-001.csv file. If you want to monitor the generation of the filtered file, remove it from the folder before running main.py and ensure that the machine has at least 20GB of RAM available for this first run
